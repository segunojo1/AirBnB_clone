# AirBnB_clone(The console)
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

# The console
General requirements: create your data model manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

# The Command Interpreter
description of the command interpreter: The command interpreter is a library (written in C) which allows the creation of programs that can accept commands given interactively by the user or programs that are sequences of commands.This application is responsible for creating the command window, accepting your configuration commands, and providing access to the built-in commands such as the Dir command.

# How to start it
To start a command interpreter, launch the command interpreter.

# How to use it
A command is nothing but a set of instruction you want the command interpreter to perform. Pressing the return key(Enter) executes the command. After a command is executed, a new prompt is issued for accepting next command from the user.
